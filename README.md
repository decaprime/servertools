simple bridge between in-game chat and your discord

first of all u need to create your discord bot and put it on your server. u need to get token for this bot (google if u cant understand what i talk about)

after installing mod go to `VRising_Server\BepInEx\config` and open `neanka.vrising2discord.cfg` file
put your token there into `Token =` field, and discord channelID (google where u can get it) into `ChannelID =`  field
that's all
